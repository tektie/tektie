Although the band recorded only one unreleased album,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y6 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the many hours spent in Studio B at the Capitol tower whetted his appetite for learning the ins and outs of the recording process.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y7 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Studying music at Los Angeles City College, UCLA, and privately with the legendary conductor-educator Joseph Valenti added form and structure</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y8 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to the guitar playing skills he had acquired at an early age. His older brother, Elliot, had given him his first guitar, instruction, and the invaluable</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y9 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">exposure to what was then the obscure, and relatively seditious form of music known as the blues. Elliot was a member of the first Mothers Of</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 ya ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Invention band, later founded the Fraternity Of Man, which gave the world “Don’t Bogart That Joint,” and then joined Captain Beefheart’s Magic</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 yb ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Band becoming known as Winged Eel Fingerling. It was with this connection that Ira eventually wrote and recorded with Captain Beefheart.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 yc ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">An early association with Lowell George led to Ira’s second record deal. Lowell produced several tracks for the band, with the executive</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 yd ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">producers being Ahmet Ertegun and Robert Stigwood. Ira returned the favor many years later by producing two tracks for the Lowell George</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 ye ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tribute album entitled Rock and Roll Doctor.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 yf ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Tours and recordings with the so-called Southern California singer/songwriter “Mafia” included associations with J.D.

One song,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y14 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the 12+ minute epic “Brownsville Girl,” went on to appear on Dylan’s Greatest Hits Vol. 3.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y15 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A long working relationship with Van Dyke Parks resulted in Ira’s involvement as both musician and producer of scores with a wide range of film,</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y16 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">television, record and commercial projects including the Howard Stern movie Private Parts, the Robert Altman-directed The Company , and the</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y17 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Brian Wilson/Van Dyke Parks collaborative album Orange Crate Art, among many others. Most recently, he performed on, mixed, and mastered</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y18 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Van Dyke’s acclaimed album, “Songs Cycled.” Following “Songs Cycled” came another collaboration with Van Dyke on a single, “Charm School.”</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y19 ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Co-written, co-produced, mixed, and mastered by Ira, it went on to receive international acclaim.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y1a ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The motion picture, Midnight Run , with a score written by Danny Elfman, featured Ira’s very prominent slide guitar over an orchestral backdrop.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y1b ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Prior to Midnight Run he performed on another Elfman score for the film Hot To Trot.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y1c ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ira has composed and performed numerous original scores and songs for film, television and commercials.</div><div class="t m0 x1 h3 y1d ff1 fs0 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">He is a founding member of jackiO, which performs in the top clubs throughout the Los Angeles area.
